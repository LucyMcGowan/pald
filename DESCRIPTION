Description: Implementation of the Partitioned Local Depths (PaLD) 
    approach which provides a measure of local depth and the cohesion of a point 
    to another which  (together with a universal threshold for distinguishing 
    strong and weak ties) may be used to reveal local and global structure in 
    data. No extraneous inputs, distributional assumptions, iterative procedures 
    nor optimization criteria are employed. This package includes functions for 
    computing local depths and cohesion as well as flexible functions for 
    plotting community networks and displays of cohesion against distance.
